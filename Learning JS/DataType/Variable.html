        변수: 바뀔수 있는 값인 기호 (variable)

        상수: 항상 같은 값인 기호 (constant)
        
        Why we use Variables.
        When we have to change a certain information, we can assign the information as a variable and change it. 

        How to code it:
        We can just say:
        Name = '~~';
        But it's easier later on to know that this is a variable, so we use:
        var Name = '~~';
        [If you are trying to use the variable to change a certain information inside a string, you must use "+Name+"]
